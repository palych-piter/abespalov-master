My Cairo notes Dec, 2008

</p>

<p class="smallstrings">


It was my second visit to <font size="+3" color="#ff0000">Cairo</font>. First time 
I went to Cairo with the excursion that I ordered 
In <font size="+1" color="#ff0000">Hurgada</font> and spent all my time in Cairo with a 
group of Russian tourists, visiting to 
<font size="+1" color="#ffff00">National Museum</font> and <font size="+1" color="#ffff00">Great Pyramids</font>. 
It was quite nice, but I didn't want to have the 
same trip that time. Moreover, I wanted to visit <font size="+2" color="#ff0000">Alexandria</font>, the city that I hadn't visited during the 
previous trip.  So, I decided to go sight-seeing without a guide that time.<br><br>
<br><br><br><br>
<img  src="../../images/Egypt-2008/Cairo/Nil.jpg" >
<br><br>

The guide, that accompanied us, said me it was not desirable to spend a lot time in Cairo alone. 
There aren't many foreigners in Cairo's streets and each foreigner, that Egyptians meet on the streets 
, can fill abnormal attention. After ten minutes discussion we came to an agreement to exchange cell phone 
numbers and keep in touch. He explained me how to go to all places I wanted to visit.   <br><br>

As my practice shown, it was true for 90 percent of places in Cairo, 
but I hadn't been run any risk during my walk . People were taking their looks at me but, in most cases, 
they were concentrated on they own activities and hadn't enough time to have conversations or spend 
a time to clarify - who that strange guy was  : 
Only once, a poor boy asked me money and I gave him five Egyptian pounds ( something about 1 US dollar ) . 
He was contented, it was quite good money for him. <br><br>

Great Pyramids and National Museum are most popular places where a lot tourists spend time,  
On the other hand, in other touristic places like <font size="+1" color="#ffff00">The Old Cairo</font> and <font size="+1" color="#ffff00">Citadel</font>, there were touristic groups also from 
different countries and the special touristic Police taking care of the tourists. 
Although, in places mentioned, I didn't meet tourists from Russia. All books I sow were in English or German only, It says that Russian 
tourists usually limit their trips by visiting the Great Pyramids and National Museum. Hmm Е they miss so much. 
  
  <br><br><br><br>

<font size="+2" color="#ffff00">1. The Old Cairo</font>  

<br><br>
  
  
<img  src="../../images/Egypt-2008/Cairo/old_cairo.jpg" >
<br><br>
  
The first place I visited was <font size="+1" color="#ffff00">the Old Cairo</font>. This is not a big area located on the Sough of Cairo. I got a taxi and it only took about 15 minutes 
To  go to this interesting place. 
As you probably know, Islam is the official religion in Egypt. But such state has been from 
7-8 centuries when Arabs came to Egypt and brought Islam. 
Earlier, prior to 7 century, Egypt was the Christian country. 
So, there are some Christian churches in Egypt that have been stored from these times. 
There are a lot of these churches in Old Cairo.
<br><br>
<br><br><br><br>

<font size="+2" color="#ffff00">2. Church of St. George</font>  

<br><br>

<img  src="../../images/Egypt-2008/Cairo/George_notes.jpg" >
<br><br>

I would like to describe couple of Old Cairo remarkable places. The first one is <font size="+1" color="#ffff00">Church of St. George</font>. 
The old church was built in 530 , At least, there are historical documents dated this year where that 
place is mentioned. There was a conflagration that destroyed the church in 1904, but the historical building was reconstructed later in 1908. There is St.George icon in the church. 
People believe that the icon has the same age as the church. They put letters and coins near the icon and believe that brings them a good health and happiness. 
There is a special room where St.George was tortured. I meet a lot of Greeks walking around the church. Looks like the place is sacred for Greece people.  
<br><br>

<br><br><br><br>

<font size="+2" color="#ffff00">3. Al-Mullaka Church</font>  

<br><br>


<img  src="../../images/Egypt-2008/Cairo/Al-Mullaka_notes.jpg" >
<br><br>

<font size="+1" color="#ffff00">Al-Mullaka Church</font> is  one of the beautiful places in The Old Cairo.  The church was built in nine century and has a lot of old Copt's icons inside. I have spent some time 
Near the church in a nice church's square and made some people fotos. Please, see the pictures below.  

<br><br>

<br><br>


The interesting fact is that recent restoration works had been doing by Russian specialists for some years. 
There is the legend that Al-Mulaka was built on that very place where the Holy Family hired Jesus from King Irod. 
Please, take a look at the board at the picture.

<br><br><br><br>

<br><br><br><br>
<font size="+2" color="#ffff00">4. Mosque of Amr-Ibn-al-As</font>  

<br><br>

<img  src="../../images/Egypt-2008/Cairo/Amr-Ibn-al-As_notes.jpg" >
<br><br>

Near the Old Cairo, there is <font size="+1" color="#ffff00">Mosque of Amr-Ibn-al-As</font> that was built in 641.  
There were a lot people walking around the church, coming inside in order to pray.           
<br><br>
 
After about 3 hours spending in the Old Cairo, I decided to move to another place and just took a look at the map I bought in advance. 
The Citadel seemed the place I was interested in. I caught a taxi Е taximan asked who I was , he meant my nationality and was quite surprised to hear that I came from Russia. 
Looks like Russian people don't visit these places :  He said he had thought that I'm looks like Italian Е, got about 5 dollars when had brought me to the place ( The Citadel ) I pointed and 
was quite happy.  <br><br>

<br><br><br><br>
<font size="+2" color="#ffff00">5. Citadel</font>  

<br><br>
<img  src="../../images/Egypt-2008/Cairo/Citadel_notes.jpg" >
<br><br>


The place I mentioned was <font size="+1" color="#ffff00">Citadel</font>, one of the beautiful places I have seen, located on the top of a mountain, over the city. Standing near the Citadel you can see the Great Pyramids ( please take a look at the cycled part of the picture provided ).  Whole the Great Cairo at you feet, it is really fantastic view. 
There were a lot children walking in the square near the Mosque. I was interested why so much children are in the same place and asked waiter I met in the cafe
 I came to drink cold water. 
 
<br><br>

He mentioned that it was happened on Fridays when children didn't visit schools but spent a lot time near Mosques walking, playing, eating snacks at all. I have not seen so many children in one place previously. 
I spent about 3 hours in Citadel. Then took the taxi to go to the place my guide mentioned to meet my group and go to the hotel, The taxman spoke English a bit and brought me to the necessary place. 
Nice day prior to Alexandria visiting Е
